# Tracking the *history* of the 2025 Trump Whitehouse

## Under Construction

### Project Goals
This project tracks the actions of the Trump Whitehouse in a public and distributed [Merkle Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree).  Note that though [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) is also a Merkle Tree, blockchain is neither free nor green nor employs unencrypted data when at rest (when the data is not moving about) the data when at rest is not transparent to the public by design.

While this repo will *not* provide better searching of historical events associated with the 2025 Whitehouse than internet-based search engines, it creates a distributed tamper-resistant history of Whitehouse events that allows people and groups to track events and to better respond to [muzzle velocity](https://doctorspin.net/muzzle-velocity-pr-strategy/) governing tactics.

One difference between [Orwellian dystopias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orwellian) and the present moment is that BlockChain and Merkle Tree technologies prevent the unnoticed alteration of history.  (Blockchain secures history - the history of transactions, preventing for example the repeated spending of the same bitcoin.)  Hence this project.
## Usage
This Git repo can be cloned directly into an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault.  Obsidian is a modern [Personal Knowledge Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) (PKM) app - also known as a practice of [making notes instead of taking notes](https://nesslabs.com/from-note-taking-to-note-making).  The idea is that one can clone this repo and use Obsidian to create/make personal notes on the contents thereof and share them accordingly, collaborating with others in multiple ways.

Being a modern PKM system, Obsidian supports both traditional linear based note making/PKM as well as non-linear note making/PKM.  An interesting/useful public example of non-linear PKM is the Obsidian based website [The Integral Guide to Well-Being](https://integralguide.com/About) - which relates to the [Internal Family System](https://ifs-institute.com/) modality of self growth.

Being a git repo, various aspects of Git/Github versioned history, providence, and ability to share, fork, collaborate (create [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)) can also be optionally leveraged.

Note that this Obsidian vault employs an optional community Obsidian plugin, [obsidian-dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview).  Loading this plugin is optional, but without it the editlog file will not list the most recently changed files in the vault.
